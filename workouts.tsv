This is our famous Fight Gone Bad workout. It has been used extensively to prep fighters for the UFC. In this workout you move from each of five stations after a minute. This is a five-minute round from which a one-minute break is allowed before repeating. Weve used this in 3 and 5 round versions. Today is 3 rounds. The stations are: 
Wall-ball  20 pound ball, 10 ft target. (Reps) 
Sumo deadlift high-pull 75 pounds (Reps) 
Box Jump  20 box (Reps) 
Push-press 75 pounds (Reps) 
Row  calories (Calories) 
The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. On call of rotate, the athlete/s must move to next station immediately for good score. One point is given for each rep, except on the rower where each calorie is one point.

20100116	"With a continuously running clock, squat for 60 seconds. Subtract the number of squats completed from 60, and do that many pull-ups in minute two. In minute three, squat again, subtracting the number completed from 60. Do that number of push-ups in minute four. Minute five is squatting again, and minute six pull-ups.
The pattern is squats, pull-ups, squats, push-ups, squats, pull-ups, etc. The goal is to stay within the workout's formula for as long as possible. 
Don't do more than 60 squats in any round.

In any case, stay moving for at least 12 minutes.
