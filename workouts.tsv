- Coach Greg Glassman 
Paleo Diet recipes: http://www.panix.com/~paleodiet/list/ Cool! 



"
20020131	"For time:
50 Push-ups
50 Pull-ups
75 Sit-ups
75 Kettlebell Swings, 1 ""pood"" kettlebell (16kg)
150 Air Squats
Perform in any order. The idea is to perform each in as 
few sets as possible. All of the reps from each exercise do not have 
to be completed before starting some from another exercise. 
Keep track of the reps and tally the total sets to completion. 
Note time to completion. Final score is total number of sets 
multiplied by time in minutes to completion.
Notes: 
1. One possible approach is to perform a near max set of push-ups, 
go on to the pull-ups, do the same with the sit-ups, etc. After the squats, 
go back to the push-ups and run through the list again finishing as much 
as you can at each exercise. 
2. Seven sets total in ten minutes for a ""70"" is an excellent score!

Tabata “Bottom to Bottom” Squats

The Tabata Bottom to Bottom Squat is a Tabata Squat but each rep begins at the bottom and ends at the bottom. The turn around at the top is immediate - no pause. The ten-second rest for each interval is also held at the bottom of the squat as opposed to the top. Interestingly, this squat, in contrast to the “normal” Tabata squat, motivates full hip extension. Also, the ten second rests don’t seem as short with this protocol!
Life is a succession of moments. To live each one is to succeed.

By selecting the duration of both the work and rest intervals, interval training can be used to focus on each of each of the three metabolic pathways. 
There are, however, hybrid intervals like the Tabata protocol (20 seconds of work followed by 10 seconds of rest repeated eight times) that have strong anaerobic and aerobic characteristics. 
Ultimately, you need to experiment with varying intervals of work and rest in pursuit of particularly challenging combinations. Variances in interval work are important to broad adaptation or great fitness.

The late Dr. Robert Atkins was the Louis Pasteur of our times. If you’ll remember from science history Pasteur was ridiculed and vilified by the media and medical community for maintaining that disease was caused by microorganisms that lived all around us. Dr. Atkins suffered similar condemnation for revealing that carbohydrate not dietary fat was the culprit in heart disease. 
The medical community is rapidly coming around to Atkins’ position and highly acclaimed science writer Gary Taubes brought the world’s attention to this shift in a piece in a July 8th, 2002 article in the New York Times Magazine entitled “What if It’s All Been A Big Fat Lie?” This article had an enormous impact on the public’s awareness of the medical community’s emerging acceptance of Atkins’ position.
Reason Magazine published a poorly researched and strongly biased criticism of Taubes’ work by Michael Fumento in March entitled “Big Fat Fake.” Longtime fans of Reason Magazine, the CrossFit staff were sorely disappointed by Mr. Fumento’s piece. Michael Fumento, otherwise, a first rate journalist, has published several articles and a book on nutrition that reveal his ignorance on the subject.

Thanks to John McCracken for recommending Men's Gymnastics Coaching Manual  by Lloyd Readhead.
“O lifting is an amazing sport for carryover. I once, on a stupid bet for a twelve pack of beer, raced a ten kilometer run without ANY (zip, zero, nada, nothing, any) running in the past year or two or three (or maybe five years), but I was getting ready for an O meet. Lots of people...lots...finished well behind me. In fact, this Nazi psycho running chick at the job I had at the time finished behind me, too.”

Your CrossFit staff played with this diet last year (thought we invented it!) and found it doable – almost fun. Eat anything-eat nothing, repeat.
The new site launch is the perfect occasion to thank all of you for your support and encouragement! The entire CrossFit.com project has been an incredible journey of the “build it and they will come” variety. 
We dedicate the new site to Coach Derek Ray, Brian Mulvaney, Otto Lejeune, Ben Elizer, Ted Socha, Robb Wolf, Dan John, Dave Werner, Nick Nibler, Athena, Jason Highbarger, Greg Amundson, Loyd Lewis, Dave Leys, Lani Lau, Eva Twardokens, Dave Young, Jim and Debie Baker, Tim Silva, Garth Taylor, Claudio Franca, BJ Penn, Cameron Earle, Nick Massman, and Philippe and Sonia Kahn

This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. Compare your time to August 5, 2003 when we did a ""mini-Diane"" at 15-12-9 reps. It's expected that you'll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill. 
If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there's a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be ""your Diane.""

For time:
21-15- and 9 reps of:
Deadlift 225
Handstand Push-ups
This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps.  It's expected that you'll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill. 
If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there's a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be ""your Diane.""

This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. Compare your time to August 5, 2003 when we did a ""mini-Diane"" at 15-12-9 reps. It's expected that you'll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill. 
If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there's a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be ""your Diane.""

""It is of interest to note that throughout history, the rise and fall of nations has seemed to coincide with the rise and fall of the physical stamina of their people. Greece rose to the height of her glory (leaving her indelible mark upon the world) during that period when the physical vigor, the patriotic zeal, the independence and freedom of her people were at their height. Athletic professionalism for the few and a lack of strenuous participation among the many brought about a decline in the national physical stamina and a consequent decline in the power of Greece. The same may be said of the great Roman Empire and of Egypt. History indicates, too, that a decadent nation realizes the costly blunder it has made only after defeat at the hands of a physically superior enemy. A period of reorganization follows and attempts are made to imbue the nation with the need of physical improvement.""

Run 1 mile
Clock starts for run on rising from last squat.
The Tabata Bottom to Bottom Squat is a Tabata Squat but each rep begins at the bottom and ends at the bottom. The turn around at the top is immediate - no pause. The ten-second rest for each interval is also held at the bottom of the squat as opposed to the top. Interestingly, this squat, in contrast to the ""normal"" Tabata squat, motivates full hip extension. Also, the ten second rests don't seem as short with this protocol!

This is our famous ""Fight Gone Bad"" workout. It has been used extensively to prep fighters for the UFC. In this workout you move from each of five stations after a minute. This is a five-minute round from which a one-minute break is allowed before repeating. We've used this in 3 and 5 round versions. Today is 3 rounds. The stations are: 
Wall-ball - 20 pound ball, 10 ft target. (Reps) 
Sumo deadlift high-pull 75 pounds (Reps) 
Box Jump - 20"" box (Reps) 
Push-press 75 pounds (Reps) 
Row  (Calories) 
The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. On call of ""rotate,"" the athlete/s must move to next station immediately for good score. One point is given for each rep, except on the rower where each calorie is one point.
