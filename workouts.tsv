20020131	"For time: 50 Push-ups 50 Pull-ups 75 Sit-ups 75 Kettlebell Swings, 1 ""pood"" kettlebell (16kg) 150 Air SquatsPerform in any order. The idea is to perform each in as  few sets as possible. All of the reps from each exercise do not have  to be completed before starting some from another exercise.  Keep track of the reps and tally the total sets to completion.  Note time to completion. Final score is total number of sets  multiplied by time in minutes to completion.Notes:  1. One possible approach is to perform a near max set of push-ups,  go on to the pull-ups, do the same with the sit-ups, etc. After the squats,  go back to the push-ups and run through the list again finishing as much  as you can at each exercise.  2. Seven sets total in ten minutes for a ""70"" is an excellent score! ____________________""Great works are performed not by strength but by perseverance."" - Samuel Johnson We've been here before, but this site is so rich with worthwhile  diet information that we've got to come back:  http://www.panix.com/~paleodiet/  "
